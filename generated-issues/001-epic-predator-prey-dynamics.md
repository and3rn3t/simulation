# Epic: Predator-Prey Dynamics System

**Labels:** epic, feature, area:ecosystem, priority:high, quarter:q3-2025
**Milestone:** Q3 2025

## Overview
Implement hunting behaviors, food chains, and ecosystem balance mechanics

## User Stories
- As an educator, I want to demonstrate predator prey-dynamics concepts
- As a student, I want to observe realistic predator prey-dynamics behavior
