# Epic: Genetic Evolution System

**Labels:** epic, feature, area:ecosystem, priority:high, quarter:q3-2025
**Milestone:** Q3 2025

## Overview
Implement trait inheritance, mutation, and natural selection

## User Stories
- As an educator, I want to demonstrate genetic evolution concepts
- As a student, I want to observe realistic genetic evolution behavior
- As a researcher, I want to model genetic evolution scenarios

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All core functionality implemented and working
- [ ] Performance requirements met (60 FPS with 1000+ organisms)
- [ ] Educational value clearly demonstrated
- [ ] Visual feedback provides clear understanding

## Sub-tasks
- [ ] Task 1: Add Genetics class with inheritable traits
- [ ] Task 2: Implement basic traits: size, speed, lifespan, reproduction rate
- [ ] Task 3: Create trait inheritance algorithm (Mendelian genetics)
- [ ] Task 4: Add mutation system with configurable mutation rate
- [ ] Task 5: Modify organism rendering to show genetic traits

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All sub-tasks completed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests validate functionality
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
- [ ] Code review completed
