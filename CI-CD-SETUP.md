# CI/CD Pipeline Summary

## 🎯 What's Been Set Up

### ✅ GitHub Actions Workflows

1. **Main CI/CD Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`)
   - Automated testing on every push/PR
   - Security scanning and dependency auditing
   - Environment-specific builds and deployments
   - Artifact management and retention

2. **Environment Management** (`.github/workflows/environment-management.yml`)
   - Manual deployment controls
   - Health checking capabilities
   - Rollback procedures
   - Dry-run testing

### ✅ Environment Configuration

- **Development** (`.env.development`) - Local development
- **Staging** (`.env.staging`) - Testing environment
- **Production** (`.env.production`) - Live environment

### ✅ Deployment Scripts

- `scripts/setup-env.js` - Environment configuration
- `scripts/deploy.js` - Deployment automation
- `scripts/monitor.js` - Health monitoring
- `scripts/setup-cicd.sh` - Initial setup

### ✅ Package.json Scripts

```bash
# Environment Management
npm run env:staging           # Configure staging environment
npm run env:production        # Configure production environment

# Building
npm run build:staging         # Build for staging
npm run build:production      # Build for production

# Deployment
npm run deploy:staging        # Deploy to staging
npm run deploy:production     # Deploy to production
npm run deploy:staging:dry    # Dry run staging deployment

# Monitoring
npm run monitor:staging       # Check staging health
npm run monitor:production    # Check production health
npm run monitor:all           # Check all environments
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Initialize CI/CD**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/setup-cicd.sh
   ./scripts/setup-cicd.sh
   ```

2. **Configure GitHub Environments**:
   - Go to repository Settings → Environments
   - Create `staging` and `production` environments
   - Set up protection rules as needed

3. **Test Deployment**:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:staging:dry
   ```

4. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   git push origin develop    # → Triggers staging deployment
   git push origin main       # → Triggers production deployment
   ```
