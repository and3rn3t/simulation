# Staging Deployment Test

This file is created to test the staging deployment workflow.

**Test Details:**
- Date: July 10, 2025
- Purpose: Verify preview/staging deployment is working
- Expected: This should trigger the deploy-staging workflow in GitHub Actions

**What should happen:**
1. GitHub Actions detects push to `develop` branch
2. Runs the CI/CD pipeline 
3. Deploys to Cloudflare Pages preview environment
4. Creates a preview URL for testing

If you can see this file at the preview URL, the staging deployment is working correctly!
