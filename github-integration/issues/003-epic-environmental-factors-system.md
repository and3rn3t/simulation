# Epic: Environmental Factors System

**Labels:** epic, area:ecosystem, priority:high, effort:L
**Milestone:** Q3 2025: Enhanced Ecosystem

## Overview
Implement environmental factors that affect organism survival including temperature zones, resource distribution, and seasonal changes.

## User Stories
- As an educator, I want to demonstrate how environment affects organism survival
- As a student, I want to see realistic environmental pressures
- As a researcher, I want to model climate impact on populations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Temperature zones affect organism survival
- [ ] Resource scarcity creates competition
- [ ] Seasonal changes impact reproduction
- [ ] Environmental gradients are configurable
- [ ] Visual representation of environmental factors

## Tasks
- [ ] Create Environment class with temperature zones
- [ ] Implement resource distribution system
- [ ] Add seasonal variation mechanics
- [ ] Create environmental stress factors
- [ ] Add environmental visualization layer

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All environmental factors implemented
- [ ] Integration with organism lifecycle
- [ ] Performance optimized for large simulations
- [ ] Educational scenarios created
- [ ] Documentation complete
