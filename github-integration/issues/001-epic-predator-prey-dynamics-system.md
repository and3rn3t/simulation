# Epic: Predator-Prey Dynamics System

**Labels:** epic, area:ecosystem, priority:high, effort:XL
**Milestone:** Q3 2025: Enhanced Ecosystem

## Overview
Implement hunting behaviors, food chains, and ecosystem balance mechanics to create realistic predator-prey relationships.

## User Stories
- As an educator, I want to show predator-prey relationships in the simulation
- As a student, I want to see realistic food chain dynamics
- As a researcher, I want to model population balance

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Carnivorous organisms can hunt herbivores
- [ ] Food chain hierarchy is configurable
- [ ] Population balance is maintained automatically
- [ ] Visual indicators show hunting behavior
- [ ] Energy system supports realistic metabolism

## Tasks
- [ ] Create BehaviorType enum and interface extensions
- [ ] Implement hunt() method in Organism class
- [ ] Add prey detection algorithm using spatial partitioning
- [ ] Create energy system for organisms
- [ ] Add visual hunting indicators

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All sub-tasks completed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests validate ecosystem balance
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
