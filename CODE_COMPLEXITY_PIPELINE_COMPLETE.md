## Overview

Successfully implemented automated code complexity analysis as part of the CI/CD pipeline, providing continuous monitoring and quality gates for code maintainability.

## Implementation Summary

### üõ†Ô∏è Core Components

#### 1. Complexity Audit Script

- **Location**: `scripts/quality/code-complexity-audit.cjs`
- **Features**:
  - Cyclomatic complexity calculation for all functions
  - Class size and method count analysis
  - Configurable complexity thresholds
  - JSON report generation for CI/CD integration
  - Warn-only mode for non-blocking pipeline integration

#### 2. Package.json Scripts

- `npm run complexity:audit` - Full complexity analysis with detailed output
- `npm run complexity:check` - Pipeline-friendly version with warn-only mode
- `npm run quality:check:full` - Enhanced quality check including complexity
- `npm run quality:gate` - Updated quality gate with complexity validation

#### 3. CI/CD Integration

- **Main CI Pipeline** (`ci-cd.yml`): Added complexity check to standard build process
- **Quality Monitoring** (`quality-monitoring.yml`): Dedicated complexity analysis job with detailed reporting
