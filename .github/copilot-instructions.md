# Organism Simulation Game - Copilot Instructions

This is a web-based organism simulation game built with Vite, TypeScript, and HTML5 Canvas.

## Project Overview
- **Purpose**: Interactive simulation showing how organisms multiply and divide over time
- **Tech Stack**: Vite, TypeScript, HTML5 Canvas
- **Features**: 
  - Organism selection with different growth/death rates
  - Real-time population visualization
  - Interactive controls for simulation parameters
  - Visual representation of organism lifecycle

## Code Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow modern ES6+ patterns
- Use Canvas API for efficient rendering
- Implement clean separation between simulation logic and UI
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
- Follow object-oriented design for organism and simulation classes

## Key Components
- `OrganismSimulation` class for core simulation logic
- `OrganismType` interface for different organism configurations
- Canvas-based rendering system
- UI controls for parameter adjustment
- Real-time statistics display
