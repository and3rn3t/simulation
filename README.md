# Organism Simulation Game

A web-based interactive simulation that demonstrates how different organisms multiply and divide over time. Watch as populations grow, evolve, and respond to environmental factors with realistic growth and death rates.

## Features

- **Multiple Organism Types**: Choose from bacteria, yeast, algae, and viruses, each with unique characteristics
- **Real-time Visualization**: Watch organisms multiply and move in real-time on HTML5 Canvas
- **Interactive Controls**: Adjust simulation speed, pause, reset, and switch between organism types
- **Population Statistics**: Track population size, generation count, and elapsed time
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Organism Types

- **Bacteria** ðŸ¦ : Fast-growing single-celled organisms (High growth rate, low death rate)
- **Yeast** ðŸŸ¡: Fungal cells with moderate growth (Medium growth rate, low death rate)
- **Algae** ðŸ”µ: Photosynthetic organisms with slow growth (Low growth rate, very low death rate)
- **Virus** ðŸ”´: Rapidly replicating infectious agents (Very high growth rate, high death rate)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

## How to Use

1. **Select an Organism**: Choose from the dropdown menu to see different growth patterns
2. **Adjust Speed**: Use the speed slider to control how fast the simulation runs
3. **Control Simulation**: Use Start, Pause, and Reset buttons to control the simulation
4. **Monitor Stats**: Watch the population count, generation number, and elapsed time

## Technology Stack

- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript for better development experience
- **HTML5 Canvas**: High-performance 2D graphics rendering
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with gradients and animations
