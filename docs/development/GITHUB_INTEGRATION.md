- 📏 `effort: XL` (1-2 months)

#### **Status Labels**

- 📋 `status: backlog`
- 🔄 `status: in-progress`
- 👀 `status: review`
- ✅ `status: done`
- 🚫 `status: blocked`

### **Phase 4: Create Milestones**

#### **Quarterly Milestones**

```yaml
Q3 2025 (July-September):

## 📋 **Issue Creation Strategy**

### **Epic Issues (High-Level Features)**

Each major roadmap item becomes an Epic issue:

```markdown
# Epic: Predator-Prey Dynamics System

## Overview
Implement hunting behaviors, food chains, and ecosystem balance mechanics.

## User Stories
- As an educator, I want to show predator-prey relationships
- As a student, I want to see realistic food chain dynamics
- As a researcher, I want to model population balance

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Carnivorous organisms can hunt herbivores
- [ ] Food chain hierarchy is configurable
- [ ] Population balance is maintained automatically
- [ ] Visual indicators show hunting behavior

## Sub-tasks
- #123 Create BehaviorType enum and interface
- #124 Implement hunt() method in Organism class
- #125 Add prey detection algorithm
- #126 Create energy system for organisms
- #127 Add visual hunting indicators

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All sub-tasks completed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests validate ecosystem balance
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
```

### **Task Issues (Specific Implementation)**

Each TODO item becomes a task issue:

```markdown
# Task: Add BehaviorType enum and extend OrganismType interface

## Description
Create the foundation for organism behavioral types to support predator-prey mechanics.

## Technical Requirements
- Add `BehaviorType` enum with HERBIVORE, CARNIVORE, OMNIVORE
- Extend `OrganismType` interface with behavior properties
- Update existing organism types with appropriate behaviors
- Add validation for behavior type assignments

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] BehaviorType enum created in appropriate module
