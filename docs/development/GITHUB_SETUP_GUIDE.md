# 🚀 Quick GitHub Integration Setup Guide

## ✅ **Step-by-Step Implementation**

### **1. Set Up GitHub Project (5 minutes)**

1. **Go to your repository** → Projects tab → "New project"
2. **Choose "Table" template** for maximum flexibility
3. **Name:** "Organism Simulation Roadmap"
4. **Add custom fields:**

   ```text
   Priority: Single select (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
   Quarter: Single select (Q3 2025, Q4 2025, Q1 2026, Q2 2026)
   Feature Area: Single select (Ecosystem, Education, Performance, UI/UX, Infrastructure)
   Effort: Single select (XS, S, M, L, XL)
   ```

### **2. Create Labels (2 minutes)**

Go to Issues → Labels → New label, create these:

**Priority Labels:**

- 🔴 `priority:critical` - #d73a49
- 🟠 `priority:high` - #ff6b35
- 🟡 `priority:medium` - #fbca04
- 🟢 `priority:low` - #28a745

**Feature Area Labels:**

- 🦠 `area:ecosystem` - #1f77b4
- 🎓 `area:education` - #ff7f0e
- ⚡ `area:performance` - #2ca02c
- 🎨 `area:ui` - #d62728
- 🏗️ `area:infrastructure` - #9467bd

**Type Labels:**

- 📋 `epic` - #0052cc
- 🔧 `task` - #0052cc
- 🐛 `bug` - #d73a49
- 💡 `enhancement` - #84b6eb

### **3. Create Milestones (3 minutes)**

Go to Issues → Milestones → New milestone:

1. **Q3 2025: Enhanced Ecosystem**
   - Due: September 30, 2025
   - Description: "Advanced organism behaviors, environmental factors, and enhanced visualization"

2. **Q4 2025: Interactive Learning**
   - Due: December 31, 2025
   - Description: "Educational content platform and save/load system"

3. **Q1 2026: Social Ecosystem**
   - Due: March 31, 2026
   - Description: "Multiplayer features and community content creation"

### **4. Generate Initial Issues (10 minutes)**

Run the issue generation script:

```bash
cd scripts
node generate-github-issues.js
```

This creates a `generated-issues/` folder with pre-written issue content. Copy and paste these into GitHub Issues, adding the suggested labels and milestones.

### **5. Configure Project Views (5 minutes)**

In your GitHub Project, create these views:

#### View 1: "Roadmap Timeline"

- Layout: Roadmap
- Group by: Milestone
- Sort by: Created date

#### View 2: "Current Sprint"

- Layout: Board
- Filter: `is:open label:"priority:high","priority:critical"`
- Columns: To do, In progress, Review, Done

#### View 3: "By Feature Area"

- Layout: Table
- Group by: Feature Area
- Show fields: Title, Assignees, Labels, Priority, Effort

---

## 🔄 **Daily Workflow**

### **For Development Work:**

1. **Check "Current Sprint" view** - See what's prioritized
2. **Pick an issue** - Assign yourself and move to "In progress"
3. **Create PR** - Reference the issue number (`Fixes #123`)
4. **After review** - Issue automatically moves to "Done" when PR merges

### **For Planning:**

1. **Weekly:** Review roadmap view for quarterly progress
2. **Monthly:** Update milestone due dates if needed
3. **Quarterly:** Plan next quarter's issues and priorities
