## Testing Infrastructure

### Mocking Strategy

- **Chart.js**: Mocked to avoid canvas rendering issues in test environment
- **LocalStorage**: Comprehensive mock for preference persistence testing
- **Canvas API**: Mocked context for heatmap rendering tests
- **DOM Elements**: Full DOM simulation for component interaction testing

### Test Environment Setup

- **Vitest**: Primary testing framework with ESM support
- **JSDOM**: Browser environment simulation
- **Canvas Mock**: Node.js canvas polyfill for rendering tests
- **TypeScript**: Full type checking during test execution

## Performance Benchmarks

### Target Performance Metrics

- **Chart Updates**: <16ms for 60fps rendering
- **Heatmap Rendering**: <100ms for 1000 data points
- **Settings Panel**: <50ms tab switching
- **Preference Loading**: <10ms from localStorage
- **Large Dataset Handling**: 1000+ organisms without significant lag

### Memory Management

- **Component Cleanup**: All components properly unmount and clean up resources
- **Event Listeners**: No memory leaks from unremoved listeners
- **Canvas Contexts**: Proper disposal of rendering contexts
- **Timer Cleanup**: All intervals and timeouts properly cleared

## Accessibility Testing

### Features Tested

- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements accessible via keyboard
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- **High Contrast Mode**: Preference system supports accessibility themes
- **Reduced Motion**: Animation preferences respected throughout system
- **Font Size**: Configurable text scaling for visual accessibility

## Error Scenarios

### Graceful Degradation Testing

- **Chart.js Initialization Failures**: Component handles missing dependencies
- **Canvas Rendering Errors**: Fallback to simplified visualizations
- **Invalid Preference Data**: Validation prevents system corruption
- **Network Failures**: Offline functionality maintained
- **Memory Constraints**: Automatic quality reduction for low-end devices

## Running Tests

### Command Line Options

```bash
# Run all visualization tests
npm run test:visualization

# Run specific test categories
npx vitest run test/unit/ui/components/ChartComponent.test.ts
npx vitest run test/unit/ui/components/HeatmapComponent.test.ts
npx vitest run test/unit/ui/components/SettingsPanelComponent.test.ts
npx vitest run test/unit/services/UserPreferencesManager.test.ts
npx vitest run test/integration/visualization-system.integration.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npx vitest run --coverage
