# ADR-002: Memory Management Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As the simulation handles potentially thousands of organisms, efficient memory management becomes critical for performance and preventing memory leaks. The application needs to:

1. **Minimize garbage collection pressure** - Frequent object creation/destruction causes performance issues
2. **Handle large populations** - Support 1000+ organisms without degradation
3. **Optimize memory layout** - Improve cache performance for better rendering
4. **Monitor memory usage** - Track and prevent memory leaks

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive memory management strategy consisting of:

### 1. Object Pooling
- **OrganismPool**: Reuse organism instances instead of creating new ones
- Pre-allocated pool of organisms to eliminate allocation overhead
- Automatic pool resizing based on usage patterns

### 2. Structure of Arrays (SoA)
- **OrganismSoA**: Cache-friendly data layout for high-performance operations
- Separate arrays for positions, ages, types instead of array of objects
- Toggleable optimization for different use cases

### 3. Memory Monitoring
- **MemoryMonitor**: Track memory usage patterns and trigger cleanup
- Configurable thresholds for memory pressure detection
- Event-based cleanup system

### 4. Layered Canvas Rendering
- **CanvasManager**: Separate background and organism layers
- Reduce full-screen redraws by updating only changed layers
- Improved rendering performance with selective updates

## Implementation

```typescript
// Object Pool Implementation
class OrganismPool {
  private pool: Organism[] = [];
  private maxSize: number;
  
  acquireOrganism(x: number, y: number, type: OrganismType): Organism {
    // Return from pool or create new if pool empty
  }
  
  releaseOrganism(organism: Organism): void {
    // Return organism to pool for reuse
  }
}

// Structure of Arrays Implementation
class OrganismSoA {
  private positions: Float32Array;
  private ages: Uint16Array;
  private types: Uint8Array;
  
  // Cache-friendly batch operations
  updatePositions(deltaTime: number): void {
    // SIMD-optimized position updates
  }
}

// Memory Monitor Implementation
class MemoryMonitor {
  startMonitoring(interval: number): void {
    // Monitor memory usage and trigger cleanup
  }
  
  isMemoryUsageSafe(): boolean {
    // Check if memory usage is within safe limits
  }
}
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Reduced GC pressure** - Object pooling eliminates frequent allocations
- **Better cache performance** - SoA layout improves memory access patterns
- **Scalable performance** - Can handle 5000+ organisms efficiently
- **Memory leak prevention** - Monitoring prevents excessive memory usage
- **Flexible optimization** - Can toggle optimizations based on population size

### Negative
- **Increased complexity** - Additional abstraction layers to manage
- **Memory overhead** - Pool and SoA structures consume base memory
- **Debugging difficulty** - Object pooling can complicate debugging
- **Implementation cost** - Significant development effort required

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. No Memory Management
- **Rejected**: Would cause performance issues with large populations
- **Issue**: Garbage collection pauses would interrupt smooth animation

### 2. Simple Object Pooling Only
- **Rejected**: Doesn't address cache performance issues
- **Issue**: Still suffers from poor memory access patterns

### 3. Web Workers for Memory Management
- **Rejected**: Complexity outweighs benefits for this use case
- **Issue**: Message passing overhead would hurt performance

## Monitoring

- **Memory usage tracking** - Monitor pool sizes and memory consumption
- **Performance metrics** - Track frame rates and update times
- **Population scaling** - Test with various population sizes
- **Memory leak detection** - Watch for growing memory usage over time
