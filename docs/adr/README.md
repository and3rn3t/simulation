# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Organism Simulation project. ADRs document the important architectural decisions made during development, including the context, options considered, and rationale for each decision.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are short text documents that capture important architectural decisions made along with their context and consequences. They help teams understand why certain decisions were made and serve as a reference for future development.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows a standard format:

- **Title**: Short noun phrase describing the decision
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Context**: The situation that led to the decision
- **Decision**: The chosen approach
- **Consequences**: The impact of the decision (positive and negative)

## Current ADRs

| ADR | Title | Status | Date |
|-----|-------|--------|------|
| [001](001-component-architecture.md) | Component-based UI Architecture | Accepted | 2025-01-01 |
| [002](002-memory-management-strategy.md) | Memory Management Strategy | Accepted | 2025-01-10 |
| [003](003-performance-optimization-algorithms.md) | Performance Optimization Algorithms | Accepted | 2025-01-10 |
| [006](006-development-tools.md) | Development Tools and Workflow | Accepted | 2025-01-15 |

## Creating New ADRs

When making significant architectural decisions, create a new ADR:

1. **Copy template** from `adr-template.md`
2. **Number sequentially** (e.g., `007-new-decision.md`)
3. **Fill in all sections** with detailed information
4. **Review with team** before marking as "Accepted"
5. **Update this index** with the new ADR

## ADR Template

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: Title

## Status

Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-YYY

## Context

Describe the situation that led to this decision. What problem are we trying to solve?

## Decision

What approach did we choose? Be specific about the decision.

## Consequences

What are the positive and negative impacts of this decision?

### Positive
- List positive consequences
- Include benefits and advantages

### Negative
- List negative consequences
- Include tradeoffs and limitations

## Alternatives Considered

What other options were considered and why were they rejected?

## Guidelines for Writing ADRs

### When to Create an ADR

- **Significant architectural changes** that affect multiple components
- **Technology choices** (frameworks, libraries, tools)
- **Design pattern decisions** that establish precedents
- **Performance optimization strategies** with wide impact
- **Security or compliance decisions** that affect the system
- **Development workflow changes** that affect the team

### Writing Tips

1. **Be concise but complete** - Include all necessary information without being verbose
2. **Use clear language** - Avoid jargon and explain technical terms
3. **Include context** - Explain why the decision was necessary
4. **Document alternatives** - Show that multiple options were considered
5. **Update status** - Mark ADRs as superseded when decisions change
6. **Link related ADRs** - Show how decisions build on each other

### Review Process

1. **Draft creation** - Author creates ADR in "Proposed" status
2. **Team review** - Discuss in team meetings or code reviews
3. **Revisions** - Incorporate feedback and update the ADR
4. **Acceptance** - Mark as "Accepted" when team agrees
5. **Implementation** - Follow the decision during development

## ADR History

### Recent Changes

- **2025-01-15**: Added ADR-006 for development tools and workflow
- **2025-01-01**: Added ADR-001 for component-based UI architecture
- **2024-12-15**: Established ADR process and documentation

### Deprecated ADRs

None currently.

## Tools and Resources

- **ADR Tools**: Consider using [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) for managing ADRs
- **Templates**: Use the template above or adapt for specific needs
- **Integration**: Link ADRs in pull requests and design documents
