# 🛠️ TruffleHog Pipeline Fix - Summary

## ✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED**

**Problem**: `Error: BASE and HEAD commits are the same. TruffleHog won't scan anything.`

**Root Cause**: The original TruffleHog configuration used fixed `base: main` and `head: HEAD` parameters, which could be identical in certain scenarios (initial commits, force pushes, etc.).

## 🔧 **Solution Implemented**

### 1. **Dynamic Commit Range Detection**

- Added intelligent logic to determine appropriate scan mode based on GitHub event type
- Prevents BASE/HEAD conflicts by using event-specific commit references

### 2. **Multiple Scan Modes**

- **Diff Mode**: For pull requests and incremental pushes
- **Filesystem Mode**: For initial commits and scheduled scans
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback with `continue-on-error: true`

### 3. **Event-Specific Behavior**

| Event Type | Scan Strategy | Base Commit | Head Commit | Description |
|------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Pull Request | Diff | PR base SHA | PR head SHA | Scans only PR changes |
| Push (with history) | Diff | Before SHA | After SHA | Scans new commits |
| Initial Push | Filesystem | N/A | N/A | Full repository scan |
| Scheduled Run | Filesystem | N/A | N/A | Complete security audit |
