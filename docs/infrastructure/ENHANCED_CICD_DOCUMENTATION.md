```

## 🎯 Quality Gates

### Pre-deployment Checks

1. **Code Quality**
   - ESLint validation (zero errors)
   - TypeScript type checking
   - Prettier formatting

2. **Testing**
   - Unit test coverage >= 75%
   - E2E test validation
   - Performance test benchmarks

3. **Security**
   - Vulnerability scanning
   - License compliance
   - Secret detection

4. **Performance**
   - Bundle size limits
   - Lighthouse score thresholds
   - Load time requirements

### Quality Score Calculation

```
Quality Score = (40% Tests + 30% Linting + 30% Type Check)
Deployment Threshold = 80% or Force Deploy flag
```

## 🚀 Deployment Strategies

### Environment Configuration

- **Development**: Local development environment
- **Staging**: Pre-production testing environment
